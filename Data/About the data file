The data file called Data_transformed_combined contains all the data we have used in training the model and the attributes in it are:
State: string
Crop: string
District: string
Year: integer (Here, the years were two combined in each row in the original data. It has been changed to have only the starting year.)
Area (Hectare): Float
Production (Tonnes): Float
Yield (Tonnes/Hectare): Float


The data has been cleaned up and made consistent in this dataset. But the extra data that is not used in training is still there.
